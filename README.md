# Q-Learning
Reinforcement Learning Simulation in Unity

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique, which is an explicit trial-and-error algorithm. 
It does not use the standard reinforcement learning model because it does not require an environment to learn. 
The goal for Q-Learning is solving for the optimal policy in an MDP. 
In other words, the policy maximizing the value returned to the agent over the course of an episode.
